CHANGES:  

- redo all analyses and viz without the outlier study, using REML estimation
- keep only one forest and funnel plot for both MAs
- do the meta regressions
- all previous scripts can be found through git, so older script parts are removed

  mutate(female = map_dbl(female_n_total_n, ~eval(parse(text = .x))),
         sessions_completed_totalsessions = str_replace_all(sessions_completed_totalsessions, ",", "."),
         completed_sessions = map_dbl(sessions_completed_totalsessions, 
                                      ~eval(parse(text = .x))))

```

The meta-analyses models were recaucluated using REML estimation. Using this only slightly changes the results, but IMO it is a more appropriate and defensible choice  @Viechtbauer2005.

```{r Build meta models}
# Model for the children self-report MA
selfrep_df <- 
  cbt %>% 
  filter(outcome == "children") 

mod_selfrep <-  
  rma(yi = hedges_g, 
      sei = hedges_se, 
      data = selfrep_df, 
      method = "REML")

mod_selfrep


# Model for the clinician rating MA
rate_df <- 
  cbt %>%
  filter(outcome == "clinician")

mod_rate <-
  rma(yi = hedges_g,
      sei = hedges_se, 
      data = rate_df,
      method = "REML")

mod_rate

```

## Outlier detection

Studies that has a confidence interval completely outside of the aggregated effect's CI should be considered outliers. We identified the 2nd study and the 1st study from the self-report and clinician rated studies as outliers (these effect sizes came from the same study), so we removed this study, and recalculated the meta-analyses.

```{r outlier detection}
# Self-report
find.outliers(mod_selfrep)
# Clinician rating
find.outliers(mod_rate)
```


```{r recalculate MA without outliers}
# Remove outliers from self-report data
selfrep_df <- 
  cbt %>% 
  filter(outcome == "children") %>% 
  slice(-2)

# Corrected model for self-report data
mod_selfrep <-  
  rma(yi = hedges_g, 
           sei = hedges_se, 
           data = selfrep_df, 
           method = "REML")

find.outliers(mod_selfrep)

# There is still one outlier, number 5 in the original dataset.
# Let's remove it as well.
selfrep_df <- 
  cbt %>% 
  filter(outcome == "children") %>% 
  slice(-2, -5)

mod_selfrep <-  
  rma(yi = hedges_g, 
           sei = hedges_se, 
           data = selfrep_df, 
           method = "REML")

# No more outliers!
find.outliers(mod_selfrep)
# This is the final model
mod_selfrep

# Remove outliers from clinician-rating data


rate_df <-   
  cbt %>% 
  filter(outcome == "clinician") %>% 
  slice(-1)

# Model for the clinician rating MA

mod_rate <-
  rma(yi = hedges_g,
      sei = hedges_se, 
      data = rate_df,
      method = "REML")

# No further outliers
find.outliers(mod_rate)
# Final model
mod_rate

```



# Forest plots
## Self-report

```{r tables will be added}
# Create tables that will be added to the forest plots
selfrep_table <-
  selfrep_df %>% 
  select(Study = study_name, N = sample_size_total)

selfrep_summary <- 
  selfrep_table %>% 
  group_by(name = "Aggregated effect") %>% 
  summarise(N = sum(N))

rate_table <-
  rate_df %>% 
  select(Study = study_name, N = sample_size_total)

rate_summary <- 
  rate_table %>% 
  group_by(name = "Aggregated effect") %>% 
  summarise(N = sum(N))
```

## Self-report
```{r fig.width = 9}

           study_table = selfrep_table,
           text_size = 4,

           xlab = "Hedges's g", 
           summary_table = selfrep_summary)
```

## Clinician rating
```{r fig.width = 9, warning = FALSE}
viz_forest(mod_rate, 
           study_table = rate_table,
           text_size = 3.5, 
           xlab = "Hedges'g", 
           summary_table = rate_summary,
           annotate_CI = TRUE)
```

# Funnel plots
## Self-report

As there seems to be some publication or small study bias, we can try to correct for that. Both models remain significant after trim-and-fill imputed studies. Also, the if we compare the overall effect size with TAF studies included, the effects remain similar.


```{r}
# trimandfill tails for the first model, while it work in  the funnel plot 
trimfill(selfrep_df$hedges_g,
         selfrep_df$hedges_se,
         ma.fixed = FALSE,
         method.tau = "REML")

# Egger's test
regtest(mod_selfrep, model = "lm")

viz_funnel(mod_selfrep, 
           method = "RE",
           sig_contours = FALSE,
           contours = TRUE,
           trim_and_fill = TRUE,
           text_size = 4)


```

## Clinician rating

```{r}
trimfill(rate_df$hedges_g,
         rate_df$hedges_se,
         ma.fixed = FALSE,
         method.tau = "REML")
# Egger's test
regtest(mod_rate, model = "lm")

viz_funnel(mod_rate, 
           method = "RE",
           sig_contours = FALSE, 
           trim_and_fill = TRUE,
           contours = TRUE,
           text_size = 4)
